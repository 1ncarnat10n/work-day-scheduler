# work-day-scheduler

## Description 

The workday scheduler is a practical and user-friendly tool for people to efficiently manage their daily tasks within 9 am to 5 pm, designed to simplify daily scheduling and organization.

This application solves the problem of time management and task planning during working hours. It allows users to input and save events for each hour, ensuring they stay organized and on top of their responsibilities. Depending on the current time, colors are used in determine what time period is the scheduler currently on (red = present, green = future, gray = past)

Through this project, I learned taught the importance of user input handling, local storage for data, and time-related operations using Day.js and JQuery. And overall, it demonstrated the practicality of using technology to improve daily productivity and time management.
